## Project description

>In this simple project our main objective was to practice **JS** by creating a *Cookie Cliker*

* main objective of a Cookie Clicker is to create a clickable central element (In this case "Teemo"), the more you click on it, the more you will gain points.

*  second objetive is to use your points to buy some *upgrades* (in this case items and buffs) to facilitate the gain of points.

> thanks to JS we created different types of *items* and buffs, animated effects on click, a pretty counter to track your score, an *Auto click* button, the possibility to save your score even if the browser page is closed, etc..

### Project Style 

>For the style of our Project we were of course inspired by the famous online game ***League of Legends*** produced by ***Riot Games***   

* all the images, icons and font come from the official site <https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/> and game **League of Legends**
